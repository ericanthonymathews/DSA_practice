Javascript and Typescript are closely related. Typescript is a programming language that is built on top of Javascript. It's meant to shore up the shortcomings of Javascript when compared to static languages(C#,C++,Python). Typescript allows for:

- Type Checking
- Refactoring
- Code Completion
- New Features

Drawbacks are:

- transpilation
- more disciplined/time-intensive coding
